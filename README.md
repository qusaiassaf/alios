Building your shell is a critical part of your operating system! A shell typically acts as the interface between the user and the system. Here are some essential functions and features your shell should include:

### **Core Functions**  
1. **Command Execution**:  
   - Accept user input and execute commands.  
   - Support for running system binaries (e.g., `ls`, `cat`, `echo`).  

2. **Built-in Commands**:  
   - Implement basic shell commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `exit`, and `clear`.  
   - These donâ€™t invoke external programs but are directly handled by the shell.  

3. **Process Management**:  
   - Allow launching foreground and background processes (e.g., `&` for background processes).  
   - Support for process suspension (`Ctrl+Z`) and resumption (`fg`/`bg`).  

4. **Input/Output Redirection**:  
   - Enable users to redirect input (`<`), output (`>`), or append to a file (`>>`).  
   - Example: `ls > file.txt`.  

5. **Piping**:  
   - Allow chaining commands with pipes (`|`), e.g., `ls | grep txt`.  

6. **Environment Variables**:  
   - Provide support for setting, accessing, and managing environment variables.  
   - Example: `$PATH`, `export VAR=value`.  

### **Advanced Features**  
1. **Command History**:  
   - Store and allow navigation through previous commands (`up`/`down` arrows).  
   - Support for `history` command to display a list of past commands.  

2. **Autocompletion**:  
   - Tab completion for file paths and commands.  

3. **Job Control**:  
   - Manage jobs with commands like `jobs`, `kill`, and `ps`.  

4. **Aliases**:  
   - Allow users to define and use command shortcuts.  
   - Example: `alias ll='ls -la'`.  

5. **Shell Scripting**:  
   - Provide support for running shell scripts with a shebang (`#!/path/to/shell`).  
   - Implement basic scripting features like loops, conditionals, and functions.  

### **User Experience**  
1. **Custom Prompt**:  
   - A customizable shell prompt, e.g., `username@hostname:~$`.  
   - Include dynamic elements like current directory or time.  

2. **Error Handling**:  
   - Provide meaningful error messages for invalid commands or syntax errors.  

3. **Theming and Colors**:  
   - Add support for colors to improve readability (e.g., for prompts and outputs).  

### **Security**  
1. **Permission Checks**:  
   - Ensure commands respect user permissions and system security.  

2. **Input Validation**:  
   - Sanitize and validate user input to prevent security issues like command injection.
